## Test Results Expected

The updated tests should now pass because they:
1. Look for the correct content (Discount Tire business info)
2. Test actual functionality (navigation, forms, responsive design)
3. Include proper wait times and error handling
4. Test the components we actually built

## Next Steps

The website is now ready for:
1. Adding real business images to `/src/assets/images/`
2. Implementing actual form submission functionality
3. Adding Google Maps integration
4. Setting up analytics and SEO optimization

The Cypress tests will now validate the actual Discount Tire website functionality instead of the old quickstart template content.
